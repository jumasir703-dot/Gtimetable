"""
First-run setup wizard.

Runs once, for a brand-new install with no teachers yet: `school_settings.
onboarding_completed` starts False, and app.py's before_request sends every
page to /setup/welcome until the wizard is finished. Existing installations
that already have teachers are marked complete automatically the first time
this app starts with the new column (see database._migrate_schema), so
nobody already using the app gets interrupted.

Steps: welcome -> teachers -> subjects -> complete.
Each step's form posts straight into this blueprint (not the main app's
/teachers/add or /subjects/add), but inserts the same rows the same way, so
by the time someone reaches the real Teachers/Subjects pages afterwards,
their data is already there.
