"""
scheduler.py
Automatic timetable generator for the School Timetable Manager.

Design decisions (per Testy's answers):
- periods_per_week is set per-subject on the Subjects page.
- If a subject has no teacher assigned yet, it is skipped entirely.
- "Avoid same subject twice a day" is a global toggle in Scheduling Rules
  (generation_settings table).
- Two per-subject rules can be added from the Scheduling Rules page
  (subject_rules table):
    - "double_lesson": schedule N two-period-in-a-row blocks per week for
      this subject (e.g. Physics gets 2 double lessons/week). Pairs are
      only formed between periods that are genuinely back-to-back in time
      (period A's end_time == period B's start_time), so a lesson never
      gets paired across the mid-morning break.
    - "not_after_period": this subject can never be placed in a period
      whose period_number is greater than the given value (e.g. Mathematics
      "not after period 6" keeps it out of the last two periods of the day).

Algorithm: greedy with day-spread preference, teacher-conflict checking
across the whole school, and load-balancing when a subject has more than
one qualified teacher. Not a full constraint solver — if the data is very
tight, some slots may go unfilled; those are reported back so you know
what to fix (add a teacher, relax a rule, free up a period) rather than
silently failing.
